The FBX import functions were tested using files exported from Blender 4.1.

####### FBX action custom properties #######
############################################

Blender 4.1's fbx exported does not export custom properties for actions.  To do so, the exporter must be modified.  Go to:
scripts\addons\io_scene_fbx\export_fbx_bin.py

In function fbx_data_animation_elements:

After:
        # For now, only one layer for all animations.
        alayer = elem_data_single_int64(root, b"AnimationLayer", get_fbx_uuid_from_key(alayer_key))
        alayer.add_string(fbx_name_class(name, b"AnimLayer"))
        alayer.add_string(b"")

Add this:
        # Custom properties.
        if scene_data.settings.use_custom_props:
            act_name = name.decode("utf-8").partition("|")[2]
            act = bpy.data.actions[act_name]
            if act is not None:
                fbx_data_element_custom_properties(astack_props, act)
